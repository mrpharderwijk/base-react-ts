### Important note on using the menu Component!

A Menu's nested children typically consists of _two children_. One child component functions as the trigger and one child component functions as the submenu. It is very important to indicate both the trigger child component and the submenu child component with their approriate key's.

#### Trigger key attribute

For a trigger child component add `key="trigger"`.

#### Submenu key attribute

For a submenu child component add `key="submenu"`
